# Raspberry Pi Statistics

A script to collect various Raspberry Pi statistics, which are sent via Telegraf to InfluxDB.

## Collecting Raspberry Pi Statistics

The provided `rpi-stats.sh` script collects statistics using Raspbian's `vcgencmd` command. These values are parsed from the command's output and formatted in InfluxDB's [line protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/) for easy collection via Telegraf's [exec](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec) input.

> To learn how to install Telegraf (and the rest of the TICK Stack) on the Raspberry Pi, refer to this [blog](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/running-the-tick-stack-on-a-raspberry-pi/).

Copy the script to the directory from which you wish to run it (I usually put it in `/usr/local/bin`), and ensure that it can be executed by the user under which Telegraf will be run (the default user is `telegraf`). The user will either need to have `sudo` rights or, it is sufficient to add the telegraf user to the `video` group using `sudo usermod -aG video telegraf`.

Configure the Telegraf [exec](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec) input to execute the script. For example...

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  # Commands array
  commands = [ "/usr/local/bin/rpi-stats.sh" ]
  # Timeout for each command to complete.
  timeout = "5s"
  # Data format to consume.
  data_format = "influx"
```

> A complete Telegraf configuration file (`telegraf.conf`) is provided to help you get started.

After Telegraf is started, data will be sent to InfluxDB.

## Import the Dashboard

A Raspberry Pi Health dashboard for Chronograf is provided in the file `Raspberry_Pi_Health.json`. This can be imported from Chronograf's Dashboards list.
